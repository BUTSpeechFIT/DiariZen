MODEL LICENSE
=============

The pre-trained model weights released in this repository ("the Models") 
are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 
International License (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Full legal text of the license is available at:

Summary of terms:
- Attribution (BY): You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license,
  and indicate if changes were made.
- NonCommercial (NC): You may not use the Models for commercial purposes.

You are free to:
- Use the Models for academic research and other non-commercial purposes.
- Share and redistribute the Models, provided that you include proper attribution
  to the authors and retain this license notice.
- Modify or adapt the Models for non-commercial use.

You must not:
- Use the Models or any derivatives thereof for commercial purposes, 
  including but not limited to products, services, or paid offerings.
- Remove or alter this license notice in any copies of the Models.

Reason for this restriction:
The Models are trained on a mixture of datasets, including those licensed under 
terms that strictly prohibit commercial usage (e.g., RAMC, MSDWild, and DIHARD-3). 
To respect the restrictive terms of all data providers and ensure legal 
compliance, the Models are released for research purposes only.

Note on License Compatibility:
We acknowledge that certain training datasets (e.g., AISHELL-4, AliMeeting) 
carry a CC BY-SA 4.0 license. However, due to the concurrent use of 
Non-Commercial (NC) datasets, providing a commercial-friendly SA license is 
logically incompatible for this specific release. As this project is part of 
an ongoing PhD research, we prioritize maximum compliance with the most 
restrictive source terms.

The source code in this repository is licensed separately under the MIT License

model weights.
